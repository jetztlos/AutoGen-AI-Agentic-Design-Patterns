This can happen if Python is not installed correctly, or if `pip` is not included in your system's PATH environment variable. Here are a few steps you could follow to resolve this:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Verify Python Installation**:\n",
      "   - Make sure that Python is properly installed on your system. You can check this by typing `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your command line or terminal. This should return the version of Python installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Install Python**:\n",
      "   - If Python is not installed, you will need to download and install it. Remember to check the option 'Add Python to PATH' at the beginning of the installation process if you're on Windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Locate pip**:\n",
      "   - After installing Python, `pip` should be installed automatically. To check if `pip` is installed, you can type `pip --version` or `pip3 --version` in your terminal.\n",
      "   - If the system still does not recognize pip, it may not be in your PATH. You can add it manually to your PATH or use the full path to call pip.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using Correct Command**:\n",
      "   - On some systems, particularly those that may have multiple versions of Python (like both Python 2 and Python 3), `pip` linked to Python 2 is usually named `pip`, and `pip` linked to Python 3 is named `pip3`. Try using `pip3 install newsapi-python`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Alternative Installation Command**:\n",
      "   - On some Linux distributions, pip is not installed by default. You can install it via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you could use:\n",
